    <h1>Function Handson</h1>
    <h2>
      Q1. Create one function with zero parameter having a console statement.
    </h2>
    <p>
      => Output is created using single function. Inside function we used simple
      console.log statement to display the output. We can see the output of the
      function in console tab.
    </p>

    <pre>
        Code:
        function display() {
            console.log("Answer of Question 1.");
        }
        display();
      </pre
    >

    <h2>
      Q2. Create one function which takes two values as a parameter and print
      the sum of them as "Sum of 3, 4 is 7".
    </h2>
    <span></span>
    <pre>
        Code:
        var num1 = 3;
        var num2 = 4;
        let output = document.querySelectorAll("span");
        console.log(output);
        function cal(a, b) {
            return a + b;
        }
        let addition = cal(num1, num2);
        output[0].innerHTML = `=> Sum of ${num1}, ${num2} is ${addition}`;
      </pre
    >
    <h2>Q3. Create one arrow function.</h2>
    <p>=> <span></span>. This is created using Arrow Function.</p>
    <pre>
        Code:
        var multiply = (v, w) => {
            return v * w;
        };
        let resultMultiply = multiply(2, 3);
        output[1].innerHTML = `Multiply of 2, 3 is ${resultMultiply}`;
    </pre>
    <h2>
      Q4.
      <pre>
Print output: 
var x = 21;
var girl = function () {
    console.log(x);
    var x = 20;
};
girl ();</pre
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      => In the above example, we can see variable x is defined two times so the
      variable is stored in the memory. Now inside the function, variable is
      first printed using console.log and then the variable is initialized with
      the value. This creates a hoisting that is the variable will be displayed
      as undefined. We can see the output in console tab.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Q5.
      <pre>
Print output: 
var x = 21;
girl ();
console.log(x)
function girl() {
    console.log(x);
    var x = 20;
};</pre
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      => In the above example, we can see variable x is declared and defined two
      times one inside function and one outside the function. so the variable is
      stored in the memory. Now inside the function, variable is first printed
      using console.log and then the variable is initialized with the value.
      This creates a hoisting that is the variable will be displayed as
      undefined. But here we see there is one more console.log before function.
      This console is writtern after the variable is initialized. So the first
      console will display the output and the second console will display as
      undefined. We can see the output in console tab.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Q6.
      <pre>
Print output

var x = 21;
a();
b();

  function a() {
    
   x = 20;
  console.log(x);
};
 function b() {
    
    x = 40;
   console.log(x);
};</pre
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      => In the above example, we can see variable x is declared and two
      functions are created named a and b. Inside this function the value is
      first changed and then printed using console.log. We can see the output in
      console tab.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Q7. Write a function that accepts parameter n and returns factorial of n.
    </h2>
    <p>=> <span></span></p>
    <pre>
            code:
            function factorial(n) {
                let fact = 1;
                for (let i = 1; i &lt= n; i++) {
                    fact = fact * i;
                }
                return fact;
            }
            let outputFact = factorial(5);
            output[2].innerHTML = `Factorial of 5 is ${outputFact}.`;
</pre
    >

    <!-- Day2 -->
    <h1>Day 2</h1>
    <h2>
      Q1.
      <pre>
Guess the Output

function FindSum(a, b){
    return a + b;
}

function DisplayData(data, batch){
    console.log(`i am from ${data} and My batch is EA${batch}`)
}

DisplayData(""PrepBytes"", FindSum(10, 9));</pre
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      => In the above program, we see two functions named "FindSum" and
      "DisplayData". FindSum returns the sum of two variables which are passed
      as parameters and DisplayData returns the output using console.log. But
      FindSum is called inside DisplayData function. Hence first FindSum is
      called and the return value is stored in DisplayData and is passed to the
      function. We can see the output in console tab.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Q2.
      <pre>
Guess the output

Abc();
const Abc = function(){
    let value = 20;
    console.log(value);
}</pre
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      => Here we can see the output is throughing an error message in console
      tab. This is because we used variable to store the function but we called
      the variable before the function is been initialized.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Q3.
      <pre>
Guess the output

var a = 10;
(function (){
    console.log(a);
    var a = 20;
})();</pre
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      => In the above example, we can see variable a is defined two times so the
      variable is stored in the memory. Now inside the function, variable is
      first printed using console.log and then the variable is initialized with
      the value. This creates a hoisting that is the variable will be displayed
      as undefined as inside the function a new variable will be created but the
      value is initialized after printed. This will show the variable as
      undefined. We can see the output in console tab.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Q4.
      <pre>
Guess the Output
const greet =  function(name){
    return function(m){
    
        console.log(`Hi!! ${name}, ${m}`);
    }
}
  
const greet_message = greet('EA19');
greet_message("Welcome To PrepBytes")</pre
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      => In the above problem, we can see inside the function anohter function
      is returned. Inside the returned function, parameters of the inner
      function and the outer function is used. After the function the first line
      calls the outer function and the value is passed to the function. Then the
      second line calls the inner function and the value is passed to the
      function. We can see the output in console tab.
